How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program?

Interpreting user needs starts with active listening and translating vague goals into clear, actionable tasks. In Agile, user stories are extremely helpful—they describe the problem from the user’s perspective and keep the team focused on delivering value. Each story represents a small piece of functionality, which I can then turn into concrete technical steps. This helps ensure that the end product matches what users actually want, not just what we assumed.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I prefer to approach development iteratively—building small pieces of functionality, testing them, and getting feedback. Agile supports this approach perfectly. In the future, I plan to keep using daily standups, sprints, retrospectives, and continuous integration to stay organized, improve teamwork, and continuously deliver working code. Agile helps me stay focused, adaptable, and always improving.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member means communicating clearly, respecting others' time and contributions, and being accountable. In Agile, everyone must collaborate, support the team goal, and give constructive feedback. I learned that success in development depends not only on technical skill but also on being reliable, flexible, and solution-oriented.
